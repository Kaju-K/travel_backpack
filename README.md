# Backpack for travelling

This is a project from Alura to understand the concepts of Javascript.

This project helps to understand how to create elements and use the LocalStorage to keep the information saved after the page is refreshed.

This is a page where someone can add itens to a list to keep track of what they want to bring to their travel.
